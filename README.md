Earnipay Mobile Engineering Code Test

## Getting Started

This project is built using Flutter v3.10.0 and Dart v3.0.0. The following steps should be carried out in sequence in order to run the Flutter application on either Android or iOS:

- In your preferred IDE, set the Flutter SDK path to Flutter 3.10.0 channel stable
- Run "flutter pub get" command in terminal
- Run the app either through terminal or the IDE's run button

All tests are in the test/all_test.dart directory and are grouped in 2 cases, success cases and error cases. To execute the tests click the run icon by the side of the individual test under any group. 

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
